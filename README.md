## Overlap In One Line Of Code

#### Using

```csharp
using NTC.OverlapSugar;
```
#### Overlap Settings

```csharp
[SerializeField] private OverlapSettings _overlapSettings;
```

#### For Single Target

```csharp
_overlapSettings.TryFind(out IDamageable damageable);
```
```csharp
_overlapSettings.TryFindInChildren(out IDamageable damageable);
```
#### For Many Targets

```csharp
private readonly List<IDamageable> _detectedDamageables = new List<IDamageable>(32);

_overlapSettings.TryFind(_detectedDamageables);
```
```csharp
private readonly List<IDamageable> _detectedDamageables = new List<IDamageable>(32);

_overlapSettings.TryFindInChildren(_detectedDamageables);
```

## Examples Of Using

`Example For Single Target:`

```csharp
    using NTC.OverlapSugar;
    using UnityEngine;

    public class UnitMeleeAttack : UnitAttack
    {
        [SerializeField] private OverlapSettings _overlapSettings;

        public void TryPerformAttack()
        {
            if (_overlapSettings.TryFind(out IDamageable damageable))
            {
                damageable.ApplyDamage(Damage);
            }
        }
    }
```

`Example For Many Targets:`

```csharp
    using NTC.OverlapSugar;
    using UnityEngine;

    public class UnitMeleeAttack : UnitAttack
    {
        [SerializeField] private OverlapSettings _overlapSettings;

        private readonly List<IDamageable> _detectedDamageables = new List<IDamageable>(32);
        
        public void TryPerformAttack()
        {
            if (_overlapSettings.TryFind(_detectedDamageables))
            {
                _detectedDamageables.ForEach(ApplyDamage);
            }
        }
        
        private void ApplyDamage(IDamageable damageable)
        {
            damageable.ApplyDamage(Damage);
        }
    }
```

## Draw Gizmos

`Also you can draw gizmos of overlap zone:`

```csharp
    public class UnitMeleeAttack : UnitAttack
    {
        [SerializeField] private OverlapSettings _overlapSettings;

#if UNITY_EDITOR
        private void OnDrawGizmos()
        {
            _overlapSettings.TryDrawGizmos();
        }
#endif
    }
```
or
```csharp
    public class UnitMeleeAttack : UnitAttack
    {
        [SerializeField] private OverlapSettings _overlapSettings;

#if UNITY_EDITOR
        private void OnDrawGizmosSelected()
        {
            _overlapSettings.TryDrawGizmos();
        }
#endif
    }
```
## Perform Overlap method

You can also use only `PerformOverlap` without components auto-finding:
```csharp
_overlapSettings.PerformOverlap();
```
Then you can find results here:
```csharp
Collider[] results = _overlapSettings.OverlapResults;
```
> **Warning!** Method `PerformOverlap` is called in `TryFind` methods!

## Custom max results size

You can set the results collection size by `Init` method:

```csharp
int maxResultsSize = 32;
_overlapSettings.Init(maxResultsSize);
```
